				 <div class="blog_des"><p>The market research Future has presented a global Forecast Report which estimates that the E-wallet market will grow at a CAGR of 15% and is expected to succeed in around $ 2100 billion by 2023. Technology is on continuous development and shifting to new stages; we've seen the emergence of a replacement player like eWallet mobile app, setting records one by one. The success stories of Google Pay, Paytm, and PayPal are an idea for many mobile app development companies and entrepreneurs.</p><p>Here, during this article, i will describe the unique features and process of E-wallet mobile app development. With the introduction of e-wallet apps, many fake apps also are wandering.</p><p><b>What are the E-wallet Payment Methods?</b></p><p>If you have decided to develop an E-wallet, it's essential to determine which mobile wallet you need.&nbsp;</p><h4>NFC</h4><p>Near Field Communication (NFC) is probably one of the best technologies getting used to transfer funds and share information with a convenient approach. These days, most E-wallets are using NFC technology for making all payments during a contactless manner.</p><h4>QR Codes&nbsp;</h4><p>QR Codes are one of the widely used technologies these days. you'll use the QR code to transact with people you often meet with or with people who are a part of your social community or office.</p><p>The only requirement of this method is to scan the QR code of another person’s smartphone.

And, payment can be received similarly.</p><p><b>The E-wallet Passbook</b></p><p>It becomes essential to add an E-wallet passbook so that users should be ready to monitor their transaction history. Additionally, you'll make use of the filter option to choose a way leading search.</p><p><b>Send money back to Bank</b></p><p>These days the E-wallet app is also offering an additional option, where the user can send money back to his bank account if he doesn't keep extra cash in the wallet.</p><p>If that quantity exceeds the limit, you can't do more transactions. For example, the monthly limit for Paytm is Rs 10k.</p><p><b>Making Bill Payments or Recharge</b></p><p>The E-wallet app facilitates you to pay your essential bills like electricity, water tax, and phone bills in the most convenient way. Besides, you'll also recharge your mobile phones or internet broadband connectivity using the same application.</p><p><b>Paying for Insurance</b></p><p>The application provides you with the facility to pay your insurance premium timely.
